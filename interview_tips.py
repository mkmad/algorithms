        1. Include raise statements and catch them using
           try & catch
        2. When you are dealing with graphs or trees, instead
           of maintaining a visited list, you can have a visited
           dict that will reduce the run time from o(n) to constant
           time during 'in' operation

        Some base cases for array inputs:
            1. empty
            2. negative numbers
            3. very big numbers
            4. repeating numbers
            5.
