    Longest increasing sub-sequence for
    3, 4, -1, 0, 6, 2, 3    is:-

    -1, 0, 2, 3 (increasing order)

    Sol:-

    Initialize the result array with 1's. Since 
    that's the min len of lis for a single element.

    Maintain two pointers i & j, i goes through
    the length of the array and j keeps iterating
    from 0 to i and finds out if the element in i is
    greater than the element in j, if it is then
    the value in the res array at the j'th position will
    be max(res[i] + 1, res[j]). This basically keeps track 
    of all the elements that are less than element in ith 
    position, which will eventually result in an array of 
    values with the length of lis at each position.

    The reason for the above formula is consider i pointing
    to 6 in the input array then j will go through 3 and 4
    thereby resulting in res[i] to be 3 and when j points to
    -1 in the input array then we can't blindly add 1 to res[i]
    even though input[i] > input[j]. This is because -1 does not
    contribute to LIS as 4 (previous element) > -1
