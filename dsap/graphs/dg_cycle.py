    """
    Take all the vertices and put it in a set (white set).
    At the same time, maintain a grey set.

    For each vertex:
        1) if the vertex is in white, then put it in grey. If
           the vertex has neighbours repeat step 1 for its
           neighbours. After visiting all its neighbours( or if the
           vertex has no neighbours) remove the vertex from grey
           set
        2) if a vertex is in grey set, then it means there is a cycle

    We also maintain a visited dict, which will help in printing
    the cycle (if it exists)

    Note: vertices must be removed from grey set after the control explores
          all possible options, else this algorithm won't work.

    Note: We can't use a simple dfs to detect a cycle in directed
          graph for the following reason(example):

          graph = {
            'A' : ['B', 'C'],
            'B': ['C'],
            'C': []
          }

          ^ This is not a cycle in directed graph, however its
            a cycle in undirected graph


         The below example is a cycle in directed graph

         graph = {
            'A' : ['B'],
            'B': ['C'],
            'C': ['A']
          }

          The reason maintaining a grey set works is because, say
          we start in 'A' (from the above example), then we put 'A'
          in grey set and recur to its neighbour ('B'). Now 'B' is
          in grey set and it moves on to 'C', now when 'C' checks
          for its neighbour ->'A' (which is in grey set) its exists
          saying its a cycle

          If we apply the same logic to the first example, since 'C'
          has no neighbour we remove 'C' from grey set and it will
          return to 'B'. Now, since 'B' explored all its neighbours
          we remove 'B' and ultimately 'A' because 'A' explored all
          its neighbours. The code exists (no cycle)

        At first, I din't have this function. I called
        dfs directly by passing 'A' as vertex param. This however,
        returned/exited at 'A' after visiting 'B' and 'C' as
        there was no cycle. But the algorithm says we need to
        make sure we work on all the vertices from white set,
        hence this function and hence the while loop.

        So, this is a unique example where I keep the code running
        even when the recursion exists prematurely while there is
        still more input data/entry points to work on
