        Whole idea is based on logarithms
        ie;  log x(y) = z -> x ** z = y

        We calculate the highest power that needs
        to be raised to 10.

        Also note, we need to get the floor value as we need
        the power of 10 to be a whole number eg given below

        Finally the number / higest power will give the
        leftmost number


        Eg:

        For 334

        mathProblems.floor(mathProblems.log10(334)) -> 2.0

        Now 10 ** 2 -> 100

        334 / 100 -> 3


        Note: Division operator gives the quotient and
              Modulo operator gives the remainder
              ie 334 % 100 -> 34

        Note: We need to take the floor of the log value
              else the value will not be what we wanted

              Eg:
                mathProblems.log10(334) -> 2.52374
                and 10 ** 2.52374 -> 333.99502

                So 334 / 10 ** 2.52374 -> 1.000...

                Which is not what we need, so the highest
                power value should be a whole number

                this will lead to denominator being exact
                powers of 10 ie 10, 100, 1000 ...

                Some more examples:

                3850 / 1000 -> 3
                3850 % 1000 -> 850

                78345 / 10000 -> 7
                78345 % 10000 -> 8345
