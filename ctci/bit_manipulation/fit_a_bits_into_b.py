    """
    You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit
    positions, i and j. Write a method to insert M into N
    such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can
    assume that the bits j through i have enough space to
    fit all of M

    Eg:

    N = 10001101000 , M = 10011 ; i = 2, j = 6

    Output: N = 10001001100


    So, you can't simple do an & or an | operation, that
    will not have all the bits of M in N. You need to
    clear all the bits between i and j before you do an
    | operation.

    Note: The positions are 0 indexed, and the rightmost
    bit is position 0 unlike strings and arrays where the
    leftmost position is 0

        Now since mask1 is all 1's we need to shift
        it j + 1 times to have all the values before
        j as 1's and after j as 0's
        
        Note: Since python interprets ints as long
        when I shift vals to the left instead of
        overflowing, the values (0's) are appending
        to the right

        Hence, I need to limit it to the number of
        bits that n had, it can be achieved by using
        a mask with the desired length of all 1's
        
        mask & (((1 << no_of_bits + 1) - 1) << j)
        
        i.e.

        Out[43]: '0b111110000000'

        where 4095 == 111111111111
        
        This works because the left part of the 
        leftmost value is technically 0's so if you
        perform & operation all those values in the 
        left of the number will be set to 0
        
        
        bin(((1 << 11 + 1) - 1) << 7)[2:] = 1111111111110000000
        4095 == 111111111111
        
        the & will look like this
        
        1111111111110000000
        &
        0000000111111111111
        
        == 111110000000
        
        Note: you typically perform the & on the same number to restrict
        the bits ie mask1
