    Peaks and Valleys: In an array of integers, a "peak"
    is an element which is greater than or equal to the
    adjacent integers and a "valley" is an element which
    is less than or equal to the adjacent integers. For
    example, in the array {S, 8, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6}, {8, 6}
    are peaks and {S, 2} are valleys. Given an array of
    integers, sort the array into an alternating sequence
    of peaks and valleys.


    Sort the numbers, place the odd position values in
    between even positioned values - nlogn
