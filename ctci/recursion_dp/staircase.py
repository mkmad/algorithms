class Staircase(object):
    """
    A child is running up a staircase with n steps
    and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps
    at a time. Implement a method to count how many
    possible ways the child can run up the stairs


    Note: Initially when I approached this problem
    I assumed that the number of ways you can reach
    the top is:

    (n-1 + n-2 + n-3) + 1

    Because I thought there is 1 more step remaining
    from n-1 or n-2 or n-3

    But, the way you are supposed to look at recursion
    is to find out how many ways can you reach the top?
    when you are looking at the code, its basically saying
    that thats the step (the + 1) from above

    n-1 is one of the ways (so is n-2 and n-3) so the
    final recursive formula then becomes:

    no of ways(n) = no of ways(n-1) + no of ways(n-2)...

    Also note: When it comes to recursion, always try to
    use memoization
