class Denominator(object):

    """
    An array A consisting of N integers is given. The denominator of array A is
    the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of A.

    For example, consider array A such that

     A[0] = 3    A[1] = 4    A[2] =  3
     A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = -1
     A[6] = 3    A[7] = 3
    The denominator of A is 3 because it occurs in 5 out of 8 elements of A
    (namely in those with indices 0, 2, 4, 6 and 7) and 5 is more than a half of 8.

    The trick is to do it in O(1) space, see below:


    Write a function

    def solution(A)

    that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns index of any
    element of array A in which the denominator of A occurs. The function
    should return −1 if array A does not have a denominator.

    Assume that:

    N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
    each element of array A is an integer within the range
    [−2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].
    For example, given array A such that

     A[0] = 3    A[1] = 4    A[2] =  3
     A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = -1
     A[6] = 3    A[7] = 3
    the function may return 0, 2, 4, 6 or 7, as explained above.

    Complexity:

    expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
    expected worst-case space complexity is O(1) (not counting the
    storage required for input arguments)

    Note:

        Basic idea of the algorithm is that if we cancel out each
        occurrence of an element e with all the other elements that
        are different from e then e will exist till end if it is a
        majority element

        IMP:  This Method only works when we are given that majority
              element do exist in the array , otherwise this method
              won’t work

        This is a perfect example of finding majority of an element in
        a collection, keep incrementing the votes if you find the element
        else decrement the votes if you don't, if the vote becomes 0 then
        the current candidate becomes the majority with 1 vote

        After finding the majority you also need to check if they won more
        than half the seats if they did then return any index of the candidate
        else return -1
