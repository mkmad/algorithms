    Given three integers A, B and K, returns the number of integers
    within the range [A..B] that are divisible by K, i.e.:

    { i : A ≤ i ≤ B, i mod K = 0 }

    For example, for A = 6, B = 11 and K = 2, your function should return
    3, because there are three numbers divisible by 2 within the range
    [6..11], namely 6, 8 and 10.

    Assume that:

    A and B are integers within the range [0..2,000,000,000];
    K is an integer within the range [1..2,000,000,000];
    A ≤ B.


    Note:
    Number of integer in the range [0 .. X] that divisible
    by K is X/K. So, within the range [A .. B], the result
    is B/K - A/K i.e. The number of integers that are divisible
    from 0 to B minus the number of integers that are divisible
    from 0 to A
